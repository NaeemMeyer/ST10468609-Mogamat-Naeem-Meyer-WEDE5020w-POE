The clients can choose from a set design or customise their own design with the help of the owners. It was Founded in 2022 and was initially a side job for a retired nurse. She started by making a wooden gift for a baby shower of her niece. SK_lasercuts started with handmade gift ideas for family into a top quality and well known business based in the southern suburbs of Cape Town.

Analysis of Current Website:
•	SK_Lasercuts currently runs out of a local southern suburb home in Cape Town and offers personalised wooden gifts, décor, frames and laser cutting designs. Currently there is no website, so they are limited to online social media accounts like Instagram and Facebook and general WhatsApp orders. Customers are relying on direct contact with the owner/designer, which limits sales and visibility.
•	Building a website creates opportunities for SK_Lasercuts to gain professional credibility and appears as more established and trustworthy. It currently limits to residents of Cape Town without a website and are unable to show off products on a daily and relies on social media posts and stories. They lack SEO visibility.
•	Advantages of SK_Lasercuts having a website is that they have 24/7 coverage of products, build trust and credibility, and can be used for marketing purposes. It is also cost effective.
Technical Requirements
•	Hardware and hosting- To be hosted by a friend of mine.
•	HTML knowledge, content and file structure.
•	CSS knowledge about styling and file structure.
•	JavaScript knowledge
•	Images, logos, icons and products
•	Asset Folder.
•	Code Editor like Virtual Studio Code
•	Github version control and browsers
•	Images Tools 
To conclude, you need domain, hosting and SSL certificates as a starting point. Building with HTML, CSS, JavaScript on Virtual Studio Code.
Design Aesthetics:
Best Fit for their wooden products would be a natural and neutral inspired design with warm earth colours like beige, browns, greens and creams. Images are high quality. Mood is handmade, warm and personal to highlight the products offered.

Base Style
The base style gives the website a warm and inviting feel. Soft beige and brown tones create a cozy look, while rounded corners and gentle shadows make sections feel friendly and approachable. The layout is clean and organized, helping visitors focus on content without feeling crowded.

Typography Styles
The typography is classic yet easy to read. Large Times New Roman headings feel professional but approachable, while paragraph text uses Verdana and similar fonts for clarity. The combination of font sizes and colors creates a calm, pleasant reading experience.

What Are the Responsive Designs
The website is responsive and flexible, meaning it looks good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Navigation adjusts for smaller screens, sections stack neatly, and text centers for easier reading. This makes browsing smooth and stress-free on any device.

Are the Images Responsive
Images are carefully scaled to fit the design. Logos, banners, and product photos resize naturally without losing quality, keeping the pages visually balanced. Galleries and client photos remain clear and well-proportioned, adding warmth and personality to the site.
